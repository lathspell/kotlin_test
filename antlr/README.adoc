# ANTLR and Kotlin

See https://tomassetti.me/getting-started-with-antlr-building-a-simple-expression-language/

Steps:

. Lexer - FooLexer.g4 defines what whitespaces, characters and special chars are called
. Parser - FooParser.g4 generates the "ParseTree" that understands the grammar of the input
. AstTransfomer - FooAstTransfomer.kt transforms the classes that were auto-generated by ANTLR
  into our model classes that build up the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Run just the ANTLR builder:

  ./gradlew generateGrammarSource -i --rerun-tasks
