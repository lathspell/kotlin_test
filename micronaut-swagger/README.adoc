Example for Micronaut with OpenAPI/Swagger API definition.

== Build ==

The OpenAPI Yaml definition as well as the Web GUIs are generated using the Kotlin pre-processor "kapt".

    ./gradlew build

=== Customize Views ===

By default all three GUIs are built. This can be customized with the following command.
It's important to use "--no-daemon" so that Gradle actually picks up the environment variable.

    JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dmicronaut.openapi.views.spec=redoc.enabled=true,rapidoc.enabled=true,swagger-ui.enabled=false,swagger-ui.theme=flattop \
        ./gradlew --no-daemon clean build
